# README #

This repository contains an R package template supporting the use of the Rcpp
and/or RcppArmadillo packages. The package template has been configured as an
RStudio project, and the following instructions assume you have
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) installed. To make full use of RStudio, the
[devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html) R
package should also be installed. The package template includes both `R` and
`C++` code, so a
[suitable](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html) `C++`
compiler must be available to build the package from source.


## Building the package from within R
```{r eval=FALSE}
Rcpp::compileAttributes()
roxygen2::roxygenize()
#devtools::document()

#devtools::test()
#devtools::build(path="build")
#devtools::check(check_dir="build")

# Optionally set an alternate path for library installation.
# libInstallPath = .libPaths()[2]
libInstallPath = ifelse(exists("libInstallPath"), libInstallPath, .libPaths()[1])

withr::with_libpaths(new=libInstallPath, devtools::install(upgrade_dependencies=FALSE))

withr::with_libpaths(new=libInstallPath, devtools::uninstall())
```
